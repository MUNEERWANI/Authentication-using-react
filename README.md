# Authentication-using-react

In this project i will be make a demo website in which i will show how to use google firebase using react in order sign up a user .After that whenever user sign in match credentials and allow access to certain pages .
Authentication is very important to protect the user data and also to make sure no one is able to access our server or data base directly 
We will authentiation token way in order to implement what we want to achieve.

<h1>Tasks i have done in this project</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Created login logout page</li>
  <p>In this  have done fetch post request to send sign up data to user and also for sign in to check verification</p>
  <li>Created state to manage routes conditionally </li>
  <p>Display certain content only when user is logged in</p>
  <li>on refresh data should not be lost or user should be still signned in</li>
  <p>For this i have used local storage to manage the token which is provided by the firebase as response upon a post request</p>
  <li>Auto logout </li>
  <p>for security reasons lets create a  auto logout  feature</p>
</ol>
